This is a series of samples, tutorials and load tests for the 
NetworkComms C# Network Library http://www.networkcomms.net/

I have recently started looking into this library.  Seems to work
well and be really well thought out.  The documentation for the 
library is seriously lacking and so as I tried to discover how it
works and how well it works I put together this series of projects.

I am still actively working on them at this moment, but I will include 
more comments and descriptive texts on each of the apps.

But, even in their present state they should be really easy to figure out.
Right now I have messaging and RPC working.  The examples that come with 
the project work well, but are incredibly difficult to see what
is going on as they are combined into one program and have tons of 
extra stuff that take away from the real simplicity of getting this
library up and working.  Once you know what you are doing they are 
sufficient, but for first time practice and proof of concept and 
learning they are more difficult than they need to be.  Therefore these are
simpler and just what is needed to get the core code working and how it works.
